```
# Import libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import rasterio
from rasterio.plot import show
```

Here, you are importing necessary libraries for your code. `numpy` is commonly used for numerical operations, `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting, and `rasterio` for handling geospatial raster data.
